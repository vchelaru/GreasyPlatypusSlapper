# Project Greasy Platypus Slapper

This project is FlatRedBall game collaboration from the FRBCon 2018 gamejam.

## Running the game

Until there is an executable, this game can be run from Glue, which is a part of the FlatRedBall game engine.

* Check out the first steps of the [BeefBall game development tutorial](http://flatredball.com/documentation/tutorials/tutorials-beefball/tutorials-beefball-creating-a-glue-project/) to see an example on getting started with Glue.
* To get started with FlatRedBall, check out the [FlatRedBall download page](http://flatredball.com/download/).

### Glue plugin prerequisites

* [Tiled Plugin](http://www.gluevault.com/plug/94-tiled-plugin) ([Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) itself is only needed to modify and create new tile map content, not to run the game.)
* [Gum Plugin](http://www.gluevault.com/plug/81-gum-plugin-glue)

For more information about installing plugins, it is covered in the first few steps of the [FlatRedBall Tiled tutorial](http://flatredball.com/documentation/tools/tiled-plugin/using-the-tiled-plugin/01-installing-requirements/).
